Get the highest cash back wherever you shop! 

## Elevator Pitch

Cash back has been around for years, but it continues to be a major way for people to save money on expenses. 
With most people owning more than one credit card, it can be difficult and time consuming to find out which 
credit card to use when they are buying groceries, shopping online, or eating out. And when the waiter asks 
for the check, it's too late to open all of your credit card apps and see which gives the highest cash back 
at Texas Roadhouse. CashCard makes getting the most cash back a simple and easy process. The ability to easily
add your favorite places and each of your credit cards makes it easy.
